# BigQuery

### Summary
BigQuery_Helper is a helper class to simplify common read-only BigQuery tasks. It makes it easy to execute queries while you're learning SQL, and provides a convenient stepping stone on the path to using the core BigQuery python API. You can try it for yourself by forking this Kaggle kernel.

### Installation
You can install BigQuery_Helper with the following command in your console:

pip install -e git+https://github.com/SohierDane/BigQuery_Helper#egg=bq_helper

If you aren't running BigQuery_Helper on Kaggle, you will also need to go through the standard BigQuery client setup and authentication process.

This repo has only been tested on Python 3.6+ and the v0.29+ of the bigquery API.
