# Google cloud BigQuery

### Summary
BigQuery_Helper is a helper class to simplify common read-only BigQuery tasks. It makes it easy to execute queries while you're learning SQL, and provides a convenient stepping stone on the path to using the core BigQuery python API. You can try it for yourself by forking this Kaggle kernel.

### Installation
You will also need to go through the standard BigQuery [client setup and authentication process](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries).
